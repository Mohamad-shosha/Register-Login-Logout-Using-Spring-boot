* Project: Maven Project
* Language: Java
* Spring Boot: Latest stable version
* Packaging: Jar
* Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, Spring Security, MySQL Driver

Click on "Generate" to download the project zip file.

### Step 2: Extract and Import into IDE

Extract the downloaded zip file and import the project into your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).

### Step 3: Define Entity

Create a simple entity class representing the user. For example, a `User` class with fields such as username and password.

### Step 4: Create Repository

Create a repository interface for the `User` entity to perform CRUD operations.

### Step 5: Create Controller

Create a controller to handle HTTP requests for user registration, login, and logout.

### Step 6: Create Frontend

Design a simple frontend using Thymeleaf templates for registration, login, and logout.

### Step 7: Run Your Application

Run your Spring Boot application. It will start a server at `http://localhost:8090`.

## üìö Technologies

* IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2023.1.3
* MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE
